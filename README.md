# MV-Dictionary


## Setup

I wrote this project using Visual Studio 2019 (comminity) version 16.8.5.

I also pulled the code from github onto my 6 year old laptop running Visual Studio 2019 v16.11.15 and the program ran fine.

The only thing required is .NET desktop development. The program is written in C#

Two projects exist in the repository: MV-Dictionary and MultiValueDictionaryTests

MV-Dictionary: the actual program
MultiValueDictionaryTests: a suite of unit tests for the program
